        <info>&lt;p&gt;Within the Triage stage, this is where you need to review the market, known risks, prior art and utility. Ensuring that we have a good understanding of what is out there in the market and where challenges may come from should this IP be released to the market. Once triage has been completed, move to Commercialisation stage or move to Closed - Lost if we are unable to release to the market and/or move forward.&lt;/p&gt;</info>
